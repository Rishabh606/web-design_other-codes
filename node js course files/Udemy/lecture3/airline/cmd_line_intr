npm init
/*
So we started with npm init to make a json file. Like git init
makes a repository. npm init used to initialise a package. This json
file contains info about this package
*/

npm install -g express  --this installs express globally
//we generally dont intall packages globally

npm intall -g express-generator
/*if you want to create a new file directory/project
having express modules by just typing express name
(including other good cmds install express generator*/

express air
//this built another directory of name air already having
//express module


https://www.lemoda.net/windows/windows2unix/windows2unix.html
//important- all linux/mac commands windows equivalent available

go to air and type "npm install" it will install
folder node modules

npm start
starts the server -
open package.json in air directory and you will see "start"
is key to "node ./bin/www" i.e. node ./bin/www can start your
server. But npm start can also do the same.

so open browser put "localhost:3000" and see express there
the css file is there in public/stylesheets

if you want to remove some folder then also remove it from
dependency list in package.json also.
Also If we remove it from package.json and want it
to automatically remove itself from package
use "npm prune"

Similarly you want to add a dependency-
1.Its better to go through command line like "npm install name"
this will automatically update dependencies in package.json
2.we can write dependecy (in proper format) directly
in package.json and type-
"npm update" on cmd line.
This will also achieve the same effect but name
and spelling should be correct. That is it will add
dependencies mentioned package.json into package.

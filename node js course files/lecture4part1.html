    <!--the break points can be made according to choice or hardcoded.-->
    <!--you start from mobile size and increase size till scroll appears there is the first break point, one can do also reverse. That is start from big go to small-->
    <!--but former approach is better (going from small to bigger is easier).-->
    <!--Or you have to hardcode it. like- from 100px-200px this action, 200-400px this is the action. this is npt recommended.-->
    <!--Media query is used to do this.-->
    <!--Note the process to find breakpoint is to make note of pixels whenever scroll appears and handle it everytime.-->
